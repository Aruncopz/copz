                                                                 Day17-Wednesday
 
      Today I am learning about Dart process function and declaration & IPv6 , SOHO LAN(Small Office/Home Office) & HTML Script function.A 
 function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters.Variables are declared using the var keyword 
 followed by variable name that you want to declare.Declare a function by providing its return value, name, and the types for its arguments. 
 The names of the arguments are optional. A function definition counts as a function declaration.
     1) Defining a Function
        A function definition specifies what and how a specific task would be done.
     2) Calling a Function
        A function must be called so as to execute it.
     3) Returning Functions
        Functions may also return value along with control, back to the caller.
     4) Parameterized Function
        Parameters are a mechanism to pass values to functions.

  Example:
         int add(int n1, int n2){
         int result;
         result = n1+n2;
         return result;
        }
 
 * Calling function In Dart
           In Dart, once a function is defined, later you can invoke or call this function inside main() function body. A function can be 
   invoked simply by its name with argument list if any.
   Syntax:-
     fun_name(<argument_list>);
   Example 1:-
     add(10,20);
 
 * Dart Passing Arguments to Function
        In Dart, when a function is invoked it may be provided with some information as per the function prototype is called as argument 
  (parameter). The number of values passed and the data type of the value passed must match the number of parameters and the data type of 
  the parameter defined during its declaration . Otherwise, the compiler throws an error.
         we have two variables num1 and num2 to be passed to add() function when function being called. These arguments are referred to as 
  actual arguments.Then, the variable n1 and n2 are initialized with the value of num1 and num2 respectively. Here, n1 and n2 are referred 
  to as formal arguments.

 * Return Value from Function
         Sometimes we may want a function to return some value to the point it where it is called from. In Dart, there is return keyword 
   allows a function to return value. The return statement is optional, if not specified the function returns null. There can be only one 
   return statement in a function.
      
      Example:-
           void main(){ 
           print("W3Adda - Dart Program To Add Two Numbers Using Function.");
           var sum = add(10,20);
           print("Sum Of Given No. Is : ${sum}");
           }
           int add(int n1, int n2){
           int result;
           result = n1+n2;
           return result;
           }
  
   IPv6:
      An IPv6 address is a 128-bit alphanumeric value that identifies an endpoint device in an Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) network.
  An IPv6 address is represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits The groups are separated by colons. 
  An example of an IPv6 address is: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. The standards provide flexibility in the representation of IPv6 
  addresses.
      IPv6 is the sixth revision to the Internet Protocol and the successor to IPv4. It functions similarly to IPv4 in that it provides the 
  unique IP addresses necessary for Internet-enabled devices to communicate.

  IPv6 defines three address types:
        *unicast
           Identifies an interface of an individual node.
        *multicast
          Identifies a group of interfaces, usually on different nodes. Packets that are sent to the multicast address go to all members of 
      the multicast group.
        *anycast
          Identifies a group of interfaces, usually on different nodes. Packets that are sent to the anycast address go to the anycast group 
       member node that is physically closest to the sender.
  
   Most IPv6 addresses do not occupy all of their possible 128 bits. This condition results in fields that are padded with zeros or contain 
   only zeros.

   SOHO LAN(Small office/Home office):
        SOHO is that it is small in both the size of the office space and the number of employees. SOHO is the smallest of the small businesses.
    The self-employed people and sometimes by a small group people up to 1-5 people are privately own and operate it.

    SOHO is usually associated with small, private business or self-employed individuals who are running their own office from home. It is 
  also often described as being small in both size of the office and number of employees. And just like the majority of today’s businesses, 
  employees use PCs in a local area network (LAN) and have access to the internet.Many small offices will have a local file server where they 
  can share files amongst each other quickly over the network. These are sometimes called “the server” by the users.

   Small ethernet only SOHO LAN:
        One of the most common local-area deployments is the Small-Office / Home-Office LAN (SOHO). It is a small computer network usually 
  built of one Ethernet switch, one router, and one wireless access point. The LAN uses Ethernet cables to connect different end-devices to 
  one of the switch ports.
        
   SOHO Single Building:
        The term small office/home office (SOHO) refers to a small business that is often run out of small office spaces, homes, or even 
  virtually. These businesses are commonly considered microenterprises. Their owners are commonly self-employed who don't need large office 
  spaces to conduct their day-to-day operations. Most use small office spaces or run their businesses from home. As such, SOHOs generally 
  employ fewer than 10 people.
 
   HTML SCRIPT FUNCTION:
         The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript). The <script> element either contains script statements, 
   or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.A script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted 
   or carried out by another program rather than by the computer process.

   Step 1: Firstly, we have to type the script tag between the starting and closing of <head> tag just after the title tag. And then, type 
   the JavaScript function. 
   Step 2: After then, we have to call the javaScript function in the Html code for displaying the information or data on the web page.
   
 STEP-1:
<Head>      
<Title>     
Call a JavaScript function  
</Title>  
<script type = "text/javascript">  
         function msgprint() {  
         }  
</script>  
</Head> 
  
 STEP-2:
   <form>  
         <input type = "button" onclick = "msgprint()" value = "Message Print">   
      </form>
