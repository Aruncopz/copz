  Today I am learning about Subnet calculating,Array,How to create login page using HTML & Friendship & Being friendly.An array is a 
 collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure where each data element can 
 be accessed directly by only using its index number.
 * JavaScript Array push()
           The push() method adds new items to the end of an array. The push() method changes the length of the array. The push() method 
  returns the new length.
 * Array pop()
           pop() is a method in Javascript whose function is to remove the final element from an array and to return that element. 
 * Array slice()
           The slice() method returns selected elements in an array, as a new array. The slice() method selects from a given start, up 
  to a (not inclusive) given end. The slice() method does not change the original array.
 * Array splice()
           The splice() method is a built-in method for JavaScript Array objects. It lets you change the content of your array by removing 
  or replacing existing elements with new ones.
 * Array unshift()
           The unshift() method adds new elements to the beginning of an array. The unshift() method overwrites the original array.
 * Array shift()
           Javascript Shift is an inbuilt Array method that removes the first element from an array and returns the removed element. 
 * Array Filter()
           The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
 * Array map()
           The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array.
 * Array find()
           The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array 
  element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.  
 * Array reduce()
           The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element. The reduce() method returns a single value: the function's 
  accumulated result. The reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements. The reduce() method does not change the 
  original array.
 
 HTML:
   * Radio comment in HTML:
          The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button. Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups. Only one radio button in 
  a group can be selected at the same time.
                   Use a <form> element.
                   Add three <label> elements with the radio input type, name and value attributes.
                   Add the required attribute within the first <label>.
                   Add an <input> with the type “submit”.
   * Placeholder comment in HTML:
          The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of a input field / textarea. The short hint is 
  displayed in the field before the user enters a value.A placeholder is a character, word, or string of characters that temporarily takes 
  the place of the final data.
   * Label comment in HTML:
          The <label> tag defines a text label for the <input> tag. The label is a normal text, by clicking which, the user can select the 
  form element. It facilitates the use of the form, since it is not always convenient to get into form elements with the cursor.
   
 HTML- login page:
       <!DOCTYPE html>    
<html>    
<head>    
    <title>Login Form</title>    
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">    
</head>    
<body>    
    <h2>Login Page</h2><br>    
    <div class="login">    
    <form id="login" method="get" action="login.php">    
        <label><b>User Name     
        </b>    
        </label>    
        <input type="text" name="Uname" id="Uname" placeholder="Username">    
        <br><br>    
        <label><b>Password     
        </b>    
        </label>    
        <input type="Password" name="Pass" id="Pass" placeholder="Password">    
        <br><br>    
        <input type="button" name="log" id="log" value="Log In Here">       
        <br><br>    
        <input type="checkbox" id="check">    
        <span>Remember me</span>    
        <br><br>    
        Forgot <a href="#">Password</a>    
    </form>     
</div>    
</body>    
</html>

  Subnet:
    A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask 
 separates the IP address into the network and host addresses. The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0” 
 address is always assigned to a network address.
  How to calculate subnet:
     * Convert to binary.
     * Calculate the subset address.
     * Find host range.
     * Calculate the total number of subsets and the hosts per subnet.
  Wildcard mask:
    A wildcard mask allows or denies all the traffic from a network IP address. The wildcard mask tells the router which bits in 
 the IP address need to match the access list and which do not.
     The main reason behind this is that unlike a subnet mask in which, binary 1, is equal to a match, and binary 0 is not a match. However, 
 in the wildcard mask, the opposite is true.Wildcard mask is 32 bits long. It acts inverted, but, with a wildcard mask, the zero bits suggest 
 that the corresponding bit position should match the same bit position in the IP address. The one bit indicates that the corresponding bit 
 position does not have to match the IP address’s bit position.
     Wildcard masks use the below-given rules to match binary 1 and 0:
       * If the wildcard mask bit 0, then it matches the bit value in the address.
       * If the wildcard mask bit 1, then you should ignore the corresponding bit value in the address.
     Wild Card Mask for a Host will always be 0.0.0.0
 
 FRIENDSHIP:
     Friendship is defined as a bond of affection between two people. People are referred to as best friends if the friendship is really strong. 
 this relationship is characterized by positive interpersonal qualities such as kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honesty.Friends bring more 
 happiness into our lives than virtually anything else. Friendships have a huge impact on your mental health and happiness. Good friends relieve 
 stress, provide comfort and joy, and prevent loneliness and isolation. Developing close friendships can also have a powerful impact on your 
 physical health.

 BEING FRIENDLY:
     Kindness – The quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.Friendly, describes people who are kind, caring, and make you feel 
 comfortable. You might be new to town, but the people are so friendly that you'll soon feel right at home. Because without friends we are 
 alone and unhappy, plus friendship makes our lives better, more positive and productive.
