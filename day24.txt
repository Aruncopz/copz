                                                             DAY24-FRIDAY
        Today me and my projectmates developed six bits game projects & then developed the application.this summary contains project code & 
  codes definition.The Ist step is too create header file,The <head> element is a container for metadata and is placed between the <html> tag 
  and the <body> tag.
      <head>
        <title>Track Twin</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" charset="utf-8" />
        <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ubuntu:wght@400;500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
     </head>    
        Then Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata  is not displayed.Metadata typically define the document title, character set, 
  styles, scripts, and other meta information. user-scalable=no , it means the website is not allowing the user to zoom in or zoom out.The 
  initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.The rel attribute specifies the relationship 
  between the current document and the linked document.Only used if the href attribute is present.The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of 
  the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
   
  <body>
    <h1>Six Bits</h1>
    <h2>Track Twin</h2>
    </body>
    
    <body>:
      The <body> tag defines the document's body.The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, 
    paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists.
    <div>:
      The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is 
    then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.The div tag is used 
    in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). Div tag has both open(<div>) 
    and closing (</div>) tag and it is mandatory to close the tag. The Div is the most usable tag in web development because it helps us to 
   separate out data in the web page and we can create a particular section for particular data or function in the web pages.
    
 <label>Select Pattern</label>    
      
     <label>:
      Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - because when a user clicks the text within the <label> 
    element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area).
 
 <button class="play_button">Start Game</button>   
  
    <button>:
      The <button> tag defines a clickable button.Inside a <button> element you can put text (and tags like <i>, <b>, <strong>, <br>, <img>, 
    etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the <input> element!
    
    <p>:
      The <p> tag defines a paragraph.Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element.
 
 <script defer src="./assets/script.js"></script>   
    
    <script>:
      The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script .The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to 
   an external script file through the src attribute.
 
 <p class="time">Time:<span></span>s</p>   
    <span> 
      The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.The <span> tag is easily styled 
   byCSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a 
  block-level element and <span> is an inline element.The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is 
  mandatory to close the tag. The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by itself. 
  span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.
    Time:
      The <time> tag defines a specific time.HTML element represents a specific period in time.
    Flip:
      The flipping effect creates a mirror image of an element. You can flip an element both horizontally and vertically.
    Refresh:
      The trick to reloading the page is to force the browser to not look into the cache, but rather to again make a connection to the Web and 
  bring up the document from the server. 
    Class:
      The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a 
  style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.The HTML class attribute
  specifies one or more class names for an element. Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements. The class 
  attribute can be used on any HTML element. 
    Section:
      The <section> tag defines a section in a document. Browser Support. The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that 
  fully supports the element.Section tag defines the section of documents such as chapters, headers, footers or any other sections. The 
  section tag divides the content into section and subsections. The section tag is used when requirements of two headers or footers or any 
  other section of documents needed.
