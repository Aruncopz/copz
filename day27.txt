   Today I am learned about javascript function's, firebase & flutter function's.JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for 
 web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that 
 cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.Text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make 
 web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive 
 elements that engage a user.
        Used to develop interactive web applications. JavaScript can power featured like interactive images, carousels, and forms. The 
 language can be used with back-end frameworks like Node js.
  
   JavaScript statements are composed of Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
      JavaScript Values:
          The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.Fixed values are called literals. Variable 
   values are called variables.
          Numbers are written with or without decimals.Strings are text, written within double or single quotes.

   JavaScript Variables:
          variables are used to store data values.JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.An equal sign is used to assign 
   values to variables.JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables.JavaScript uses arithmetic operators 
   ( + - *  / ) to compute values.
 
   JavaScript Expressions:
          An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.The computation is called an evaluation.
   Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an expression . Since expressions produce values, they can appear anywhere in a 
   program where JavaScript expects a value such as the arguments of a function invocation.

   Identifiers are names;In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions, and labels.The rules for legal 
   names are much the same in most programming languages.In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar 
   sign ($).Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. 

       One of many HTML methods is getElementById().This example uses the method to "find" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes 
   the element content (innerHTML) to "hi"    
     <html>
     <body>

     <h1>What</h1>
     <p id="demo">Hi Arun</p>
     <button type="button"
     onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'bye'">hi</button>

    </body>
    </html>
     
     The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.In this example x, y, and z are given values, and 
  finally z is displayedWhen separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
  <html>
  <body>
  <p>hi</p>
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
  var x = 5;
  var y = 6;
  var z = x + y;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = z;
  </script>

  </body>
  </html>
 
   FIREBASE:
       The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from 
   client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive 
   experience.Firebase authentication and analytics are the most widely used. Firebase has evolved to become a platform that allows mobile 
   and web front-end developers to develop complete applications without the need for back-end servers.Google Firebase is a Google-backed 
   application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking 
   analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment.

     Link web app to Hosting site:
         Link a Firebase Web App to a Firebase Hosting site.  Each Hosting site can only be linked to a single Firebase Web App.You may need 
    to link your web app to your Hosting site in the Project settings if you chose not to set up Hosting when you registered your web app 
    with your Firebase project.1)Sign in to Firebase, then open your project.2) Click the Settings icon, then select Project settings.
    3) In the Your apps card, select the web app that you want to link to a Hosting site.4) Click Link to Firebase Hosting site.
    5) Select a Hosting site to link to, then click Link.
     Unlink a Hosting site:
        In the Your apps card, select the web app that you want to unlink from a Hosting site.Click the overflow icon next to the name of 
     the linked-to site, then select Unlink.
 
     Firebase Real-time Databases use WebSockets to keep an eye on data changes on the server side and those changes are reflected in 
   real time on the client side.
