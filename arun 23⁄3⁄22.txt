       This is my 2nd day of my session.I will learn new things today session.I will learn types of GUI's & somthing about computer networking and then solving the 
   problem and understand how to solve the problem.Today i will learn how to solve the problrm & then how to handle the problrm.More number of topic covered 
   by kowshik.The problemsolving method solved by four ways,
                                *Understanding the problem.
                                *Write down all the constraints.
                                *List out the operations.
                                *Arrange the operation & satisfying the constraints.

   3.10. It is the GNOME front-end to the PackageKit, in turn a front-end to several package management systems, which include systems based on both RPM and DEB.

      3)XFCE;
               XFCE is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and Unix-like operating systems. Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight while still being 
   visually appealing and easy to use. Xfce embodies the traditional Unix philosophy of modularity and re-usability.
      
      4)LXDE;
               LXDE is a free desktop environment with comparatively low resource requirements. This makes it especially suitable for use on older or 
   resource-constrained personal computers such as netbooks or system on a chip computers.

      5)MATE;
               MATE is a desktop environment composed of free and open-source software that runs on Linux, BSD, and illumos operating systems.
