                                                                       28/3/22- Monday
    This my 5th day session.Today i will learn about problem solving ,git intallation & git uses & computer hardwares & what is computer.Problem solving is 
 used in anywhere and then any situation. Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, 
 and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution.Effective problem-solving skills result in “happier, more confident, and more 
 independent” individuals.Problem solving can help you track down the culprit, diagnose the cause of the stain and develop an action plan to get your home 
 clean and fresh again.
    In order to be effective at problem solving you are likely to need some other key skills, which include:
                          *Creativity
                          * Team work
                          * Researching skills
                          * Emotional Intelligence
                          * Risk management
                          * Decision making
     Git;
      Git  is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code 
 during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running 
 on different systems).
 
    Basic overview of how Git works:

          * Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
          * Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
          * Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
          * "Push" your changes to your main branch
          * Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
          * "Pull" the changes to your local machine
          * Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
          * Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
          * "Merge" your branch to the main branch.
    
    Advantages;

         * Performance. Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. ...
         * Security. Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. ...
         * Flexibility. ...
         * Wide acceptance. ...
         * Quality open source project.

   Computer;
        A computer is a machine that can store and process information. Most computers rely on a binary system, which uses two variables, 0 and 1, to complete
     tasks such as storing data, calculating algorithms, and displaying information.

   Computer hardwares;
         computer hardware is the physical components that a computer system requires to function. It encompasses everything with a circuit board that 
   operates within a PC or laptop; including the motherboard, graphics card, CPU (Central Processing Unit), ventilation fans, webcam, power supply, and so on.

   Types of computer networks;

         Motherboard, central processing unit, random access memory, hard disk drive, monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, speaker, joystick are the  
   10 examples of computer hardware.

   Explanation:

       1) The physical component that is needed for the computer system to function is called hardware.
       2) The main circuit board of a computer is a motherboard.
       3) All the information from the programs are processed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
       4) Random Access Memory stores the data temporarily and it is a hardware.
       5) In a computer, the main data storage device is the hard disk drive.
       6) The hardware that is used to display the information such as video and graphics is the monitor.
       7) The interaction with the computer is made by the keyboard and it is a typing device.
       8) The hand-held device that is used to select the options in the screen is the mouse.
       9) The hard copies of the data is generated by the printer and it is the output device.
      10) By using speakers, we can listen to music, watch movies.
      11) The input device that is used by the user to interact with the system is joystick.
