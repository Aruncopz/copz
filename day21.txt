                                                              Day21-Tuesday
     Today I am learning about how to configure two router in cisco packettracer & Basic flutter.In this network, 2 router and 2 PCs are used. 
  Computers are connected with routers using a copper straight-through cable. After forming the network, to check network connectivity a 
  simple PDU is transferred from PC0 to PC1. The network simulation status is successful. From this network, it can be observed that the 
  router handles data transfers between multiple devices.  
  
  *Step-1(Configuring Router1):

   * Select the router and Open CLI.
   * Press ENTER to start configuring Router1.
   * Type enable to activate the privileged mode.
   * Type config t(configure terminal) to access the configuration menu.
   * Type no shutdown to finish.
  
  Router1 Command Line Interface:
      * Router>enable
      * Router#config t
      * Router(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0
      * Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
      * Router(config-if)#no shutdown
      * Router(config-if)#
      * Router(config-if)#interface Serial0/1
      * Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
      * Router(config-if)#no shutdown

  *Step-2(Configuring Router2):
   
       * Select the router and Open CLI.
       * Press ENTER to start configuring Router2.
       * Type enable to activate the privileged mode.
       * Type config t(configure terminal) to access the configuration menu.
       * Type no shutdown to finish.

   Router2 Command Line Interface:
        * Router>enable
        * Router#config t
        * Router(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0
        * Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.254.0
        * Router(config-if)#no shutdown
        * Router(config-if)#
        * Router(config-if)#interface Serial0/1
        * Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.254.0
        * Router(config-if)#no shutdown
     
   *Step-3(Configuring PCs):

        * Assign IP Addresses to every PC in the network.
        * Select the PC, Go to the desktop and select IP Configuration and assign an IP address, Default gateway, Subnet Mask
        * Assign the default gateway of PC0 as 192.168.10.1.
        * Assign the default gateway of PC1 as 192.168.30.1. Finally ping command used to connect two pcu's.

    In between these works we had a financial discipline session by Mr gokul, who was met by abraham anna, he is a charted accountant by 
  profession, he started his session by 12 pm, he was not prepared for a speech which was a good,as he could speak his heart out, he gave us 
  an idea about where to spend, where not to spend, keep a track of money that we spend and buy assets instead of liabilities, he also 
  discussed about the book rich dad poor dad, and made clear that investing in lands is way better than buying property or appartements, he 
  also discussed about buying gold jewellery,which does not give returns as that of land, and he also gave an example from his life that was, 
  his dad bought a land in his name few years back instead of getting him a bike and the value of land now is almost equal to 45lakhs, on the 
  other hand if his father would have bought him a bike he would have to sell it in less than half the price he bought, he also mentioned 
  investing in mutual funds and health insurances which are very important, as we can claim them on emergency situation, the hospital bills 
  now a days are far beyound what we expect, so if we invest a little bit of our savings in these health insurances we can reduce the amount of 
  tax we pay to our government and secure our family and ourselves when in need, it was such an interactive session we gained a lot of 
  informations which are mentioned above and the session was over by 1 pm.

  Flutter:
   * to flap the wings rapidly butterflies fluttering among the flowers.* to move with quick wavering or flapping motions a sail fluttering 
  in the wind. * to vibrate in irregular spasms his heart fluttered.* to move about or behave in an agitated aimless manner She nervously 
  fluttered around the office.
