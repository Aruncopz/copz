                                                              Day22-Wednesday
    Today I am learned about how to communicate between two networks using protocal on cisco packet tracer, Introduction of flutter.
   Configuring steps: 
        In this configuring using two pcu's , two swiches , three routers. All networks connected eachother with the help of ethernet cable.
   In this network, a router and 2 PCs are used. Computers are connected with routers using a copper straight-through cable. After forming 
   the network, to check network connectivity a simple PDU is transferred from PC0 to PC1. The network simulation status is successful. 
   From this network, it can be observed that the router handles data transfers between multiple devices.    
        Step-1(Configuring PCs):
         * Assign IP Addresses to every PC in the network.
         * Select the PC, Go to the desktop and select IP Configuration and assign an IP address, Default gateway, Subnet Mask
         * Assign the default gateway of PC0 as 192.168.10.1.
         * Assign the default gateway of PC1 as 192.168.20.1.
        Step-2(Connecting PCs with Router):
         * Connect FastEthernet0 port of PC0 with FastEthernet0/0 port of Router1 using a copper straight-through cable.
         * Connect FastEthernet0 port of PC1 with FastEthernet0/1 port of Router1 using a copper straight-through cable.  
        Step-3(Configuring Router1):
         * Select the router and Open CLI.
         * Press ENTER to start configuring Router1.
         * Type enable to activate the privileged mode.
         * Type config t(configure terminal) to access the configuration menu.
         * Configure interfaces of Router1:
            • Type interface FastEthernet0/0 to access FastEthernet0/0 and Configure the FastEthernet0/0 interface with the IP address 
         192.168.10.1 and Subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
         * Configure router-1 serial port & router-3 serial port.
         * Type no shutdown to finish.
        Step-4(Configuring router2)            
           * Select the router and Open CLI.
           * Press ENTER to start configuring Router2.
           * Type enable to activate the privileged mode.
           * Type config t(configure terminal) to access the configuration menu.
           * Configure interfaces of Router2:
               Type interface FastEthernet0/1 to access GigabitEthernet0/0 and Configure the FastEthernet0/1 interface with IP address 
           192.168.20.1 and Subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
            * Configure router-2 serial port & router-1 serial port.
            * Type no shutdown to finish.
        Step-5(Configuring router3)
           * Configure router-3 serial port & router-2 serial port.
        Step-6:
           * Apply Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocal on three routers.
   
    FLUTTER:
        Widgets:
          The core concept of the Flutter framework is In Flutter, Everything is a widget. Widgets are basically user interface components 
    used to create the user interface of the application.
        Basic's of flutter:
         * MyApp is the user created widget and it is build using the Flutter native widget, MaterialApp.

         * MaterialApp has a home property to specify the user interface of the home page, which is again a user created widget, MyHomePage.

         * MyHomePage is build using another flutter native widget, Scaffold

         * Scaffold has two properties – body and appBar

         * body is used to specify its main user interface and appBar is used to specify its header user interface

         * Header UI is build using flutter native widget, AppBar and Body UI is build using Center widget.

         * The Center widget has a property, Child, which refers the actual content and it is build using Text widget.
      
      Layout widgets can be grouped into two distinct category based on its child:
         * Widget supporting a single child.
         * Widget supporting multiple child.
 
         Padding − 
           Used to arrange its child widget by the given padding. Here, padding can be provided by EdgeInsets class.

         Align − 
           Align its child widget within itself using the value of alignment property. The value for alignment property can be provided by 
         FractionalOffset class.
  
         Container − 
           Generic, single child, box based container widget with alignment, padding, border and margin along with rich styling features.

         Center − 
           Simple, Single child container widget, which centers its child widget.

         Stateless Widget - 
           The widgets whose state can not be altered once they are built are called stateless widgets. These widgets are immutable once they 
          are built i.e any amount of change in the variables, icons, buttons, or retrieving data can not change the state of the app.
         
          Stateful Widget -
            Stateful Widgets are dynamic widgets. They can be updated during runtime based on user action or data change. Stateful Widgets 
           have an internal state and can re-render if the input data changes or if Widget's state changes. For Example: Checkbox, Radio Button, 
           Slider are Stateful Widgets.
