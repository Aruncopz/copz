                                                               Day14- Friday
     Today I am learning about what is ip address & classes,subnet,Dart language,dart function, language.Dart is a client-optimized language 
 for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, 
 paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.
   Dart function:
   return_type function_name ( parameters ) 
   {
   // Body of function
   return value;
   }
 Ex:
   int add(int a, int b)
{
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
}
 
void main()
{
    var output = add(10, 20);
    print(output);
}

Output-30

 Dart Function with parameter and return value:

    void main() {
    print("Example of add two number using the function");
    // Creating a Function.
    int sum(int a, int b){
    // function Body.
    int result;
    result = a+b;
    return result;

  The computer language is defined as code or syntax which is used to write programs or any specific applications. The computer language is 
 used to communicate with computers.composition is an act or mechanism to combine simple functions to build more complicated ones. Like the 
 usual composition of functions in mathematics, the result of each function is passed as the argument of the next, and the result of the last 
 one is the result of the whole.
 
 IP ADDRESS:
         IP address or Internet Protocol address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network. Computers use IP addresses 
 to communicate with each other both over the internet as well as on other networks.IP address is, as such, generally shown as 4 octets of 
 numbers from 0-255 represented in decimal form instead of binary form.Ip address classes,
            1) Class A
            2) Class B
            3) Class C
            4) Class D
            5) Class E
 
    Class A:
      IP address belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts.
                     1)The network ID is 8 bits long.
                     2)The host ID is 24 bits long.
      The higher order bit of the first octet in class A is always set to 0. The remaining 7 bits in first octet are used to determine 
  network ID. The 24 bits of host ID are used to determine the host in any network.
  	            *1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.254 	
                    *Supports 16 million hosts on each of 127 networks.

    Class B:
      IP address belonging to class B are assigned to the networks that ranges from medium-sized to large-sized networks.
                       1)The network ID is 16 bits long.
                       2)The host ID is 16 bits long.
     The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class B are always set to 10. The remaining 14 bits are used to determine 
  network ID. The 16 bits of host ID is used to determine the host in any network.
                     *128.1.0.1 to 191.255.255.254 	
                     *Supports 65,000 hosts on each of 16,000 networks.
  
    Class C:
      IP address belonging to class C are assigned to small-sized networks.
                      1) The network ID is 24 bits long.
                      2) The host ID is 8 bits long.
     The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class C are always set to 110. The remaining 21 bits are used to determine 
  network ID. The 8 bits of host ID is used to determine the host in any network.
                      *192.0.1.1 to 223.255.254.254 	
                      *Supports 254 hosts on each of 2 million networks.

    Class D:
      IP address belonging to class D are reserved for multi-casting. The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses belonging to 
  class D are always set to 1110.
                      *224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 	
                      *Reserved for multicast groups.

    Class E:
      IP addresses belonging to class E are reserved for experimental and research purposes. 
                      *240.0.0.0 to 254.255.255.254 	
                      *Reserved for future use, or research and development purposes.
      
  Subnet mask:
      A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can
   travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.Subnet calculating steps
   The number of subnets is found by counting the number of bits by which the initial mask was extended, also known as the subnet bits.
