    Today I am learned about HTML Position's, Sidebar in css, Personal Computer.The position property specifies the type of positioning method 
  used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right 
  properties.These properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the 
  position value.
    Static position:
       An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
  Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.Static position structure;
        <html>
        <head>
        <style>
           div.static {
           position: static;
           border: 3px blue;
         }
         </style>
         </head>
         <body>
         <h2></h2>
         <p></p>
         <div class="static">
         </div>

         </body>
         </html>
 
    Relative position:
         The top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal 
  position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. Relative position structure;
         div.relative {
         position: relative;
         left: 30px;
         border: 3px green;
         }

    Fixed position:
         Positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, 
  bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally 
  have been located.
          div.fixed {
          position: fixed;
          bottom: 0;
          right: 0;
          width: 300px;
          border: 3px red;
          } 
      
    Absolute position:
           absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed . The top , right , bottom , and 
   left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block.
         div.absolute {
         position: absolute;
         top: 80px;
         width: 200px;
         border: 3px brown;
         }   
    
    Sticky position:
          Sticky positioning can be thought of as a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. A stickily positioned element is treated as 
    relatively positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed until it reaches the boundary of its 
    parent.

         div.sticky {
         position: sticky;
         top: 0;
         background-color: green;
         border: 2px pink;
         }

    Side bar:
     Sidebar is usually used to display information that is not a part of the main content. Traditionally it’s a vertical column on the left 
   or right side of the website, with modern CSS its possible to have this in a variety of shapes and even hide it in a modal window.Basic 
   structure of sidebar,   
       
     <body>
     <div class="sidebar">
     <div>mahi</div>
     <div>copz</div>
     <div>arun</div>
     </div>
     <div class="body-text">
     </div>
     </body>

   large storage capacity, and a powerful central processing unit. A desktop computer, normally more powerful than a normal PC and often 
   dedicated to a specific task, such as graphics.Common uses for workstations include computer-aided design (CAD), 3D graphics and 
   animation, video and audio production, weather modeling, and other simulations and scientific work.

   Laptop:
