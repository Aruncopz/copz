                                                         Day23-Thursday
        Today I am learned about html,css & flutter basic commands and procedures and then Cultural talks(Reality,what you want,stress).HTML, 
  in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet. Each retrieval unit is known 
  as a Web page, and such pages frequently contain hypertext links that allow related pages to be retrieved.HTML—“HyperText Markup Language”
  is the language used to tell your web browser what each part of a website is. So, using HTML, you can define headers, paragraphs, links, 
  images, and more. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML . 
  CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.CSS is the language for describing the 
  presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such 
  as large screens, small screens.Difference between html & css;
  
  * HTML:
    1.HTML is used to define a structure of a web page.
    2.It consists of tags inside which text is enclosed.	
    3.HTML doesn’t have further types.	
    4.We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet.	
    5.HTML is not used for presentation and visualization.
    6.HTML has comparatively less backup and support.

  * CSS:

 * HTML:
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the language which is used to define the structure of a web page. HTML is used along 
   with CSS and Java script to design web pages. HTML is the basic building block of a website. It has different attributes and elements 
   with different properties.Each element has a opening and a closing tag. We can also add images by the help of HTML.
       Example:
          <html>
          <body>
          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          </body>
          </html>
 * CSS:
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to style web documents. It is used to provide the background color and is also used 
   for styling. It can also be used to style the font and change its size.
    Example:
      <html>
      <head>
      <style>
      body {
       background-color:red;
      }
      </style>
      </head>
      <body>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This page has red background color</p>
  </body>
  </html>

 * Flutter:
     * How to create container:
          The container in Flutter is a parent widget that can contain multiple child widgets and manage them efficiently through width, 
   height, padding, background color, etc. It is a widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing of the child widgets. 
   It is also a class to store one or more widgets and position them on the screen according to our needs.
     * Properties of container widget:
         1. child: 
             This property is used to store the child widget of the container.
         2. color: 
             This property is used to set the background color of the text.
         3. height and width: 
             This property is used to set the container's height and width according to our needs.
         4. margin: 
             This property is used to surround the empty space around the container. 
         5. padding:
             This property is used to set the distance between the border of the container (all four directions) and its child widget. 
         6. alignment: 
             This property is used to set the position of the child within the container. Flutter allows the user to align its 
           element in various ways such as center, bottom, bottom center, topLeft, centerRight, left, right, and many more. 
         7. decoration: 
             This property allows the developer to add decoration on the widget. It decorates or paint the widget behind the child. If we 
           want to decorate or paint in front of a child, we need to use the forgroundDecoration parameter.
         8. transform: 
             The transform property allows developers to rotate the container. It can rotate the container in any direction, e.x, change 
           the container coordinate in the parent widget.
         9. constraints: 
             This property is used when we want to add additional constraints to the child. It contains various constructors, such as tight, 
           loose, expand, etc.

  * Cultural talks:
        Reality:
           Reality means anything that exists. An event that has actually happened, or a thing which really exists is said to have "reality".
    Something close to reality is realistic. Reality is the state of things as they are, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined.
    To live on own reality or create own reality.Reality is often contrasted with what is imaginary, delusional, in the mind, dreams, what is 
    false, what is fictional.Philosophy looks at the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the mind (as well as language 
    and culture) and reality.
      * Stress:
            Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry,
         or nervous. Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand.Stress means physical or mental tension. An example of stress is
         the pressure to finish three large projects by the end of the day. An example of stress is discomfort and pain in your arms from 
         carrying too heavy of an item.
     * Stress relief:
            Eat a well-balanced diet, get enough sleep, and exercise on a regular basis. Engage in self-relaxation. Try muscle relaxation, 
         breathing or meditation exercises, prayer, yoga, or swimming to reduce stress. Spend time with nature or listen to quiet music.
